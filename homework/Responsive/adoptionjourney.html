            <p>If you're in the Miami area, I highly recommend Miami Dade Animal Services. It is the government shelter meaning that they are a kill shelter so it's imperative that people try to adopt these dogs before they're euthanized.</p>

            <p>I recommend going on a weekday as they become extremely busy on weekends. The adoption process goes as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>Go to the front desk and take a number. This will be the order in which you're called to see if the dogs you liked are available for adoption</li>
              <li>Now, start looking at the dogs. There are 6 different rooms in which the dogs are kept. Rooms A-C contain small-medium size dogs. Rooms D-G contain bigger dogs.</li>
              <li>Every dog will have their own ID card that states their name, approximate age, health status, and a unique ID code. Take a picture of the code as that is what you will bring to the front desk to see if they're available for adoption</li>
              <li>Once you've seen all the dogs and you're confident you have pictures of all the ID numbers of the dogs you liked, return to the front desk and wait for your number to be called to see which ones are available</li>
              <li>You'll get the option to play with the dogs you liked and see if you want to bring Fido home!</li>
            </ul>
            If you do choose to adopt, the shelter will make arrangements to spay/neuter your dog if needed and to give the dog any shots or treatments it may need. They will give you a pick up date once all the procedures are done!
