          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p> My name is Alanna Cooper. I am a senior at University of Miami studying media management and the proud owner of a rescue named Duke. I adopted Duke in October of 2017 and he is the first dog I've ever owned. Although it was difficult to adjust at first, Duke has become my best friend. As a first time dog owner living on a college budget, I've learned tips for choosing the right pup for you and how to give your pup the best life possible without breaking the bank.</p>

        <p>I adopted Duke on October 27th, 2017. He was the only dog that wasn't barking in the packed shelter and he looked so small and scared. Although nobody is fully sure of his background, the shelter believes he was abandoned by his family during Hurricane Irma and that he is a Belgian Malinois/Boxer mix. They could only estimate his age to be between 1 and 3 so I'm choosing to celebrate his 3rd birthday this month on October 27th, the one year anniversary of his adoption. Duke is an incredibly sweet, quiet, and expressive dog and I couldn't imagine life without him.  </p>
