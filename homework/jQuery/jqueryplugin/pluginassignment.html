    <h1 id="header" id="changetext">Jamaica Travel Guide</h1>

    <img id="guideimage" src="images/jamaicaguide.jpg">

    <p>My mother's family is from Jamaica and it is one of the most beautiful countries on Earth. I have not had the pleasure of visiting in years but the country is rich in scenery and culture. The most popular tourist destinations in Jamaica are Montego Bay and Negril. With its slow pace, long sandy beaches, lush rainforests, stunning waterfalls, and great music scene (Reggae started here!), Jamaica is exactly what the doctor ordered for a tropical vacation. This Caribbean island has plenty to offer travelers of all kinds. From those seeking resorts, a party scene, a relaxing holiday, or a more local look at the culture. Whatever you want, Jamaica has you covered! Although it would be very easy to spend most of your time on beaches, try to experience the local music scene and Rastafarian culture. Avoid going during spring break when college students swarm the island and prices skyrocket. This guide on where to stay will place you in just the right location.</p>

              <p><em>Food</em>
              <br>  Fish is a big staple of Jamaican food and will be served everywhere. Red beans and rice, jerk chicken or pork, sweet potato pudding, meat pies are also typical Jamaican dishes. While youâ€™re there, make sure to try their world-renowned Blue Mountain coffee. Lunch and casual meals cost around $4.50 USD, while dinner will be about $10 USD. Expect to pay $65 USD per week for groceries if you plan on cooking. That price includes foods like pasta, vegetables, chicken, along with other basic foods.</p>

              <p><em>Transportation</em>
              <br> Buses are the best way to get around Jamaica. The trip from Kingston to Montego Bay takes 5 hours and costs $24 USD. Negril to Montego Bay is 2 hours and costs $10 USD. For transportation within a city, the buses in Jamaica are extremely inexpensive, under $1 USD per trip. Taxis, on the other hand, are expensive. Expect $18 USD for a 10-mile trip. Uber, the taxi alternative, is available in Kingston.</p>
